# Programming Languages Repository

Welcome to the **Programming Languages** repository! This repository serves as a collection of relatively simple programs written in different programming languages. The goal is to provide a space to practice, explore, and learn various programming languages.

## Purpose

- Learn new programming languages through hands-on practice.
- Compare syntax and features across different languages.
- Build a reference for common programming tasks in multiple languages.
- Improve problem-solving skills by implementing simple programs.
